<!--
	For testing purposes at the moment. Will have a mod setting on release. Currently, patches apparel and weapon bases to have a Normal TickerType so they can self-repair when made out of self-healing stuff.
	Might expand it to all ThingWithComps with TickerType Never (perhaps only with CompEquippable) in the future.
